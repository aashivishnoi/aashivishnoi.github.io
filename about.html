<h2>
  <break> Our idea came to life through the girls who code summer immersion programming camp. Through the skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and overall computer science that we obtained throughout the camp, we were able to succeed in creating a website that was meaningful in many aspects. Our team established daily check-ins to make sure we were all on the same page. Furthermore, we utilized the kanban method and stand-up meetings in order to further our progress. It is centered around helping immigrants adjust into a new society and communities without feeling alienated. </break>
